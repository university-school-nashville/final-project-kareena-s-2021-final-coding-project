My final is project is going to be a game of tic tac toe.  
Before making any while or for loops, I am going to create a "hashtag" using python and nubmers (ex. 1 / 2 / 3/
                                                                                                     - + - + -
                                                                                                     4 / 5 / 6/ 
                                                                                                     - + - + - 
                                                                                                     7 / 8 / 9/)
                                                                                                 
Then, after that I will create either a while loop that allows the reader to play against me.
