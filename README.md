My final is project is going to be a game of tic tac toe, using Turtle. 
First, before making any while or for loops, I am going to draw out the intial "hashtag" using Turtle.
Then, after that I will create either a while loop or a for loop. I will use this to try and make Turtle into a game engine. After that, the reader will play a game of tic tac toe with the computer. 

I wonder who will win?
